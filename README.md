# Bank Telemarketing Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

## Description

This project focuses on data analytics and exploration of a dataset of a bank's telemarketing endeavors. The dataset comprises information related to the bank's telemarketing campaigns, primarily centered around promoting long-term deposit accounts, such as bonds and savings accounts. The bank often engaged in multiple interactions with potential customers before determining whether they would opt for a long-term deposit account.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to assist the bank in refining its telemarketing strategy for promoting long-term deposit accounts. By leveraging data analytics techniques, we aim to gain valuable insights from the dataset and provide actionable recommendations that can enhance the bank's marketing efforts.

## Key Tasks

1. **Data Exploration**: Thoroughly explore the dataset to gain a deep understanding of the available data and its characteristics.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: This step involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for analysis, ensuring its quality and consistency.

3. **Descriptive Analysis**: Perform a descriptive analysis to extract meaningful statistics and insights from the dataset.

4. **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizing machine learning algorithms, build predictive models to identify potential leads for long-term deposit accounts.

## Project Setup

Copy the data into the folder `data`. Copy the artifacts from here: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qlDzaAJiNvI39f5vehXJkv6TpcIqbz6e?usp=sharing) and put the files inside the `artifacts` folder. It's also possible to generate the artifacts by running the notebook `notebooks/modeling.ipynb`

1. Install the packages using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. To run the backend server, use the command `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`.
3. To run the streamlit application, use the command `streamlit run frontend/app.py`.
